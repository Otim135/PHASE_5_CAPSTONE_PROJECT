    "\n",
    "### **Context & Rationale**\n",
    "\n",
    "Accurate rainfall prediction plays a pivotal role across various sectors, including agriculture, disaster preparedness, and urban planning. In agriculture, timely and precise forecasts are essential to avoid crop losses, while in urban planning, accurate predictions help mitigate the risk of flooding and infrastructure damage. Additionally, accurate rainfall predictions support disaster preparedness by allowing authorities to take proactive measures, reducing economic and social disruptions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional weather prediction models often rely on rigid, rule-based systems that struggle to account for the complex, non-linear relationships between meteorological variables. This limitation frequently results in less reliable forecasts and missed opportunities for early intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Opportunity**\n",
    "\n",
    "This project seeks to address these challenges by adopting a modern, AI-driven approach to rainfall prediction. Through the use of advanced machine learning techniques, we aim to develop a high-accuracy binary classification model that can predict rainfall occurrence with unprecedented precision, ultimately improving decision-making across multiple critical sectors.\n",
